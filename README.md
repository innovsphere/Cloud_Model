# Image Classification/Processing Model Deployment

This project outlines the steps to deploy an image classification or processing model on Hugging Face, create a pipeline, and integrate the pipeline into your code for execution.

## Tasks

1. **Deploy the Model on Hugging Face**
   - Host your image classification or processing model on the Hugging Face platform.

2. **Create a Pipeline**
   - Develop a pipeline to facilitate the execution of the deployed model.

3. **Integrate and Execute the Pipeline**
   - Add the created pipeline to your codebase.
   - Run the integrated code to ensure functionality.

## Steps to Follow

1. Prepare the model and ensure it is compatible with Hugging Face's deployment requirements.
2. Push the model to Hugging Face using the `transformers` library or directly through the platform.
3. Define and test a pipeline for inference.
4. Incorporate the pipeline into your project code.
5. Validate the end-to-end workflow by running the code and verifying results.



Feel free to reach out with any questions or issues while deploying or testing the pipeline!
